## Chat React App

This is Chat React App made with React. 

### Description

The project is a chat react app made with React.js, Sockets, Rest APIs, Hooks, Axios, and ChatEngine.io. The backend is hosted on the chatengine.io. In order to build this project I created the account on chatengine.io, I created the project, I copied the project ID and secret key, I created users, and I created the chat to which I added users. I used useState React Hook to manage the state of the app. The username and password credentials are stored in LocalStorage, this is why it is possible to login with different credentials to the chat (as different users) after refreshing the browser. Axios API serves to fetch data from chatengine.io, the request is asynchronous.
